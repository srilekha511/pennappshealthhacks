Welcome! Our team (of highschoolers: 3 sophomores and a senior) is very content to present our solution for screening and assessment of Parkinson's disease.
<div class="About">(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Therefore, We are proposing a software to identify Parkinson's early signs. If Parkinson's is identified, We provide you with any resources you may find helpful. If results show "neurotypical," We provide access to resources and ideas/daily exercises to be able to prevent Parkinson's along with other similar disorders and/or diseases such as Alzheimer's... <br> BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN PREVENTION AS EQUALLY AS WE DO, CURE! ♥ヽ(◕‿◕✿)> </div>
<h1/>*VIRTUAL HUG AND SUPPORT TO YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES* ⧹(⦁ᴗ⦁)⧸ </h1>
 MORE THAN <STRONG> 10 MILLION PEOPLE </strong> ARE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S DISEASE!
<br> Identify it early so you can act to block its progression.. either in you or a loved one!!!

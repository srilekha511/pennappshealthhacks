          You will know if you don't have Parkinson's if the website outputs that you do not exhibit the common symptoms of PD. 
          PDetect can still help! Over time, PDetect can help you monitor possible symptoms of Parkinsons. Currently having 
          limited treatments and no cure, the progression of Parkinson’s disease cannot be stopped. However, 
          early detection can help as starting treatment in earlier stages of the disease can slow this progression. 
          PDetect can also help you find your local medical facility in case you would like to consult your doctor as well.</p>

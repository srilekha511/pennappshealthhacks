          <p class="body-text1">
            Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, chronic disease
            that affects movement. Specifically, Parkinson’s targets
            dopamine-producing neurons in an area of the brain called the
            substantia nigra.

            Symptoms often develop gradually over many years. The most common
            symptoms include tremors, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and balance
            problems.
